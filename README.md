Challenges in the Game
The "Traffic Mastery" game introduces a series of challenges designed to help users learn and apply traffic rules in a practical and engaging way. These challenges aim to develop reflexes, focus, and discipline while driving.

List of Challenges:
Stopping at the STOP sign for 3 seconds:

Scenario: The user approaches an intersection with a STOP sign. They must come to a complete stop and wait for 3 seconds before proceeding.
Objective: Develop the habit of respecting mandatory stops, ensuring safety at intersections.
Immediate feedback: "Insufficient stop! Ensure you fully stop for 3 seconds."

Stopping at pedestrian crossings:
Scenario: A pedestrian approaches the crosswalk. The user must slow down and stop the vehicle to give priority to the pedestrian.
Objective: Encourage responsible behavior toward pedestrians and reduce accident risks.

Maintaining speed below 50 km/h:
Scenario: The user drives through an urban area with a speed limit of 50 km/h. They must adjust acceleration to stay within the allowed limit.
Objective: Promote responsible driving and compliance with speed limits.

Avoiding a road under construction:
Scenario: The user encounters a blocked road due to construction. They must follow the signs and choose the correct alternative route.
Objective: Develop the ability to adapt to unexpected traffic changes.

If the steps are not followed the game will reset and the user will have to do the challenges again.

How They Are Integrated into the Game:
Gamification: Each challenge is integrated into the game in order to provide a fun and interactive learning environment.
Progression: As the user advances, challenges become more complex, combining multiple rules to follow simultaneously (e.g., stopping at a STOP sign and yielding to pedestrians).

Impact:
These challenges are essential for developing proper reflexes and behaviors in traffic. They simulate real-life scenarios, giving users the opportunity to learn from mistakes in a safe environment and gradually improve their performance.
